# GNN
This repository includes the Graph Neural Network implementation that I concluded from the source: https://youtu.be/8owQBFAHw7E

I have compared the accuracies obtained by 3 different data sources. Also I have implemented a normalizer function at the end of the colab notebook. However, it didn't change the accuracy significantly, since the graph data was in the form of binary.
